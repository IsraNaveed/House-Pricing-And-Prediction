# House Pricing Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that applies various machine learning and deep learning models to predict house prices using the provided dataset.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for house prices. The notebook explores the data, preprocesses it, and applies several machine learning models to predict house prices. Additionally, a deep learning model is also trained and evaluated.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided as `train.csv`. It contains various features related to houses and their sale prices.

## Methodology

1. **Load the Data**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and convert categorical variables to numeric.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data and visualize correlations.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Prepare the features and target variable for modeling.
5. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Train at least three different machine learning models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
   - Train a deep learning model using Keras.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the models.
7. **Conclusion and Insights**: Summarize findings and model performances.

## Machine Learning Models

- **Linear Regression**: A simple linear approach to model the relationship between features and the target variable.
- **Decision Tree**: A non-linear model that splits the data into subsets to make predictions.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve prediction accuracy.

## Deep Learning Model

- **Deep Neural Network**: A model built using Keras with multiple dense layers to capture complex patterns in the data.

## Results

- The performance of each model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- A comparison of the models is provided to determine the best-performing model.

## Instructions for Running the Notebook

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/house-pricing-prediction.git
